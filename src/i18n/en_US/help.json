      "CONTENT_1": "On a public chain, anyone can read and write data. Reading data is free, but there is a cost to write data to the public chain. This overhead helps prevent spam and protects its security through payments. Any node on the network (each connection device containing a copy of the account is called a node) can participate in the protection of the network by means known as mining. Because mining requires computing power and electricity, the miners’ services need to be compensated. This is also the reason for the miner’s fees.The miners preferentially package gas with reasonable gas prices. If the miner’s fee paid when the user trades is very low, the transaction may not be packaged by the miner, resulting in a transaction failure.",

      "CONTENT_2": "The mnemonic is another form of expression of the plaintext private key, originally proposed by the BIP39 proposal. Its purpose is to help the user memorize complex private keys (64-bit hash values). The mnemonics are generally composed of 12, 15, 18, and 21 words. These words are taken from a fixed vocabulary. The generation order is also based on a certain algorithm. Therefore, the user does not need to worry about inputting 12 words casually to generate a word. address. The mnemonics can be used as another form of private key. It is an unencrypted private key. There is no security at all. Any person can get your mnemonic and can take away your assets effortlessly.Therefore, after the user has backed up the mnemonic, he must pay attention to three points: 1. Use physical media as much as possible to back up, for example, using a pen to copy on paper, etc., as far as possible not to use screenshots or photographs and place them in a networked device. Anti-hacked 2. Check the mnemonic of the backup for many times is correct. Once one or two words are misspelled, it will bring great difficulties to recover the correct mnemonic. 3. The mnemonics after backup Words are properly kept and anti-theft measures are to be taken.",
